-- You would need to add similar INSERT ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE statements for ALL puzzles from src/lib/puzzle-data.ts
-- if they are not already in your database or if you want to ensure they are up-to-date.
-- For brevity, only a few are shown here.

-- Add RLS for increment_leaderboard_score function if it wasn't explicitly defined with security definer
-- This depends on how the function was initially created. If it's SECURITY DEFINER, it runs with creator's permissions.
-- If it's SECURITY INVOKER (default), it needs specific grants or RLS bypass if called by anon/auth key directly.
-- Assuming the function might need to be callable by authenticated users to update their own score indirectly.
-- However, the `increment_leaderboard_score` is called from backend (apiClient), which should use service_role key and bypass RLS.
-- So, explicit RLS on the function itself is usually not needed if called correctly from a secure backend context.
-- If you were calling it directly from client-side RPC with user's token, then you'd need RLS.
-- For now, I'll assume backend calls with service_role, so no direct RLS change for the function here.
-- If you create functions from the dashboard, ensure to set "SECURITY DEFINER" if they need elevated permissions.

-- Make sure the user_id in 'leaderboard_entries' correctly references 'profiles.id'
-- This constraint should already be in the full schema. If it was missed or incorrect:
-- Example (ensure this matches your actual table structure and existing constraints before running):
-- ALTER TABLE public.leaderboard_entries DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS leaderboard_entries_user_id_fkey;
-- ALTER TABLE public.leaderboard_entries
-- ADD CONSTRAINT leaderboard_entries_user_id_fkey
-- FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES public.profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow users to manage their own game progress" ON public.user_game_progress;
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to manage their own game progress"

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to read puzzles" ON public.puzzles;
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read puzzles"

FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);


-- Note: The `increment_leaderboard_score` function is typically called from a trusted backend environment
-- (like a Supabase Edge Function using the service_role key) which bypasses RLS.
-- If called directly from the client, it would need appropriate RLS or to be a SECURITY DEFINER function.
-- The current `apiClient.ts` calls RPC functions, these calls from the client are made using the user's session.
-- Thus, the RPC function itself might need to be `SECURITY DEFINER` or have specific grants.
-- For `increment_leaderboard_score` to modify `leaderboard_entries` (which is likely RLS protected for insert/update to service_role or specific conditions),
-- it's best for the function to be `SECURITY DEFINER` and perform its own checks if necessary, or be called only by a trusted server.
-- The provided RPC function in the schema uses `SECURITY INVOKER` which is the default.
-- To allow users to update their own score (indirectly via the function), the function needs to be `SECURITY DEFINER`
-- or the `leaderboard_entries` table needs RLS policies allowing users to update their own entries through this function's logic.

-- Let's assume we want the function to operate with definer privileges to update the leaderboard:
-- (This should be part of the function definition in the main schema file if it's not already)
-- Example if function wasn't SECURITY DEFINER:
-- CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.increment_leaderboard_score(p_user_id uuid, p_score_increment integer, p_period text)
-- RETURNS void
-- LANGUAGE plpgsql
-- SECURITY DEFINER -- Add this
-- AS $$
-- BEGIN
--   -- function body as before
-- END;
-- $$;
