Student's Mood: "{{{mood}}}"
Student's Focus Level: {{{focusLevel}}}/10

Consider the mood and focus level in combination. For example:
- If mood is "Stressed" and focus is low: Suggest a quick relaxation technique or a short break.
- If mood is "Energized" and focus is high: Suggest how to leverage this state for productive study.
- If mood is "Neutral" and focus is medium: Suggest a way to boost focus or a mindful activity.

Suggestions should be specific and easy to implement (e.g., "Try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique to reduce anxiety.", "Take a 10-minute walk to refresh your mind.", "Listen to some calming music for 15 minutes.", "Plan a short, focused study session on a single topic.").
Avoid generic advice. Aim for variety in suggestions.
